# Ritual

- [x] create tasks
- [x] render tasks to the screen
- [x] Toggle task completion by clicking on checkbox.
- [x] Completing all tasks updates streak.
- [x] unchecking a task undoes the streak increment for that day
- [x] All tasks reset at midnight.
- [x] Streak either increments or resets to zero each day.
- [x] Persist state to Firebase.
- [x] Be able to delete tasks.
- [ ] User accounts and authentication.
- [ ] Host on Now.

## Bugs

- [ ] Cannot submit an empty task.
- [ ] Adding a new task on the same day lets you complete it and bump your streak up. Possible solution, when streak increment, remove Add component. ( try using that conditional function in jsx thing you learnt)

## Future
- [ ] be able to update and Reorganise Tasks.
